# Profile Photo Placeholder

This is a placeholder for your profile photo. 

To add your actual photo:
1. Save your photo as `profile-photo.jpg` in this directory
2. Make sure it's a square or portrait orientation for best results (the CSS will crop it into a perfect circle)
3. Recommended size: at least 400x400 pixels for crisp display

The CSS automatically handles:
- Cropping the image into a perfect circle
- Scaling and centering the image
- Adding a subtle border and shadow
- Hover effects for interactivity

Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
